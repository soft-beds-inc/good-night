# Project Preferences

## Bulk Operations
- ALWAYS confirm scope explicitly before executing bulk operations (especially S3 copies)
- Show what WILL be affected before running
- Show what will NOT be affected (exclusions)
- When user says 'except' or 'but not', double-check understanding
- Format: 'I will [operation] affecting: ✓ [included] ✗ [excluded]. Proceed?'
- Wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding
- User experienced panic when AI was about to execute wrong scope - prevent this
