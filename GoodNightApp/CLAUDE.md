# Project Preferences

## Issue Detection
- Don't flag one-off corrections or directional requests as patterns requiring skills
- Only create issues for truly repeatable problems that appear multiple times
- One-time corrections within a single session are not patterns - they're normal interaction
- Focus on issues that would genuinely improve workflow if automated, not minor variations
